# E-commerce-data-analysis
In this project, we will be analysing eCommerce Database for Mazen factory, an online retailer. Our goal is to analyze and optimize marketing channels, measure and test website conversion performance, and use data to understand the impact of new product launches.

We analyse the impact of changes brought by the company like new products, pages, cross selling items and paid traffics to observe improvements in KPIs (session to order conversion rates, revenue and margins, conversion funnel improvements, etc.).
This is a guided project (a part of udemy advanced SQL course). The Database has been created by Maven Analytics(around 4.72 lakh records of 3 year retail data)
